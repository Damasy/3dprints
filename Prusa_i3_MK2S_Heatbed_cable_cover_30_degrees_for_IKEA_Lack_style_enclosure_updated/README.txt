# Summary

Prusa i3 MK2(S) Heatbed cable cover 30 degrees for IKEA style enclosure, including the new Prusa designed version https://www.prusaprinters.org/cheap-simple-3d-printer-enclosure

This prevent the stress and pressure on the heatbed cable and bed / stepper on the MK2 and MK2S in a 55 x 55 cm IKEA style enclosure. It's just a modified version of the original heatbed cable cover, cut and angled 30 degrees upwards. 

Was inspired by the 90 degree version made for the MK2.5 / MK3 version done here:  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837970

Note: Originally this model was 45 degrees, but as mauber (https://www.thingiverse.com/mauber/about) pointed out, the cables for the heatblock would crash into it in the back left corner. I made a 6 mm deeper version, it still didn't solve the problem. Then Ruedli (https://www.thingiverse.com/Ruedli/about) was kind enough to make a 30 degree version of my last edition, and this time it works!
